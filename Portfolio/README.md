# Yandex.Practicum projects

Projects I worked on while studying at Yandex.Practicum. 

Projects are sorted by completion date - the newer the project, the higher it is located. The project number is also indicated at the beginning of the project folder name. Each folder contains three files:
* Project notebook in English with 'EN' in the beginning
* Project notebook in Russian with 'RU' in the beginning
* README.md file containing a description of the project. The description is first provided in English, followed by Russian.
